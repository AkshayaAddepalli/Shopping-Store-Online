An Online Store Shopping System developed in Java that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming principles such as inheritance,
interfaces, implementation of interfaces, method overloading, and polymorphism. The application simulates a real-world e-commerce environment 


where users can browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases.

The system is designed with a structured class hierarchy to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability. It incorporates logical validation, 
organized data handling, and clear separation of responsibilities across classes. This project strengthened my understanding of OOP design, program structure, and real-world application development using Java.
